## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures

**Symptoms:**

- CI pipeline fails at testing stage
- Specific test cases failing

**Resolution:**

```bash
# Run tests locally
./setup-dev.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app php artisan test

# Check specific test
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app php artisan test --filter=TestName

# Debug with verbose output
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app php artisan test --verbose
```

#### Deployment Failures

**Symptoms:**

- Deployment pipeline fails
- Application not accessible after deployment

**Resolution:**

```bash
# Check deployment logs
gh run view [run-id] --log

# Manual rollback
cd /opt/laravel-recipes
docker-compose down
git checkout previous-working-commit
docker-compose up -d

# Check application health
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

#### Database Migration Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Migration fails during deployment
- Database schema inconsistencies

**Resolution:**

```bash
# Check migration status
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:status

# Rollback migrations
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:rollback

# Fix migration and redeploy
git commit -m "fix: migration issue"
git push origin main
```

#### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**

- Lighthouse scores below threshold
- Load test failures

**Resolution:**

```bash
# Check current performance
npm run lighthouse

# Profile application
docker-compose exec app php artisan telescope:install
docker-compose exec app php artisan vendor:publish --tag=telescope-assets

# Optimize application
docker-compose exec app php artisan optimize
docker-compose exec app php artisan config:cache
docker-compose exec app php artisan route:cache
```

### Debug Commands

#### Pipeline Debugging

```bash
# View workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run details
gh run view [run-id]

# Download run artifacts
gh run download [run-id]

# Cancel running workflow
gh run cancel [run-id]
```

#### Application Debugging

```bash
# Access application container
docker-compose exec app bash

# View application logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Check database connectivity
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
>>> DB::connection()->getMongoDB()->listCollections()

# Check queue status
docker-compose exec app php artisan queue:monitor
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Optimization

```bash
# Analyze slow queries
docker-compose exec mongodb mongo --eval "db.setProfilingLevel(2)"

# Check index usage
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
>>> DB::connection()->getMongoDB()->explain()

# Optimize indexes
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh
```

#### Application Optimization

```bash
# Enable OPcache
docker-compose exec app php -m | grep OPcache

# Cache configuration
docker-compose exec app php artisan config:cache
docker-compose exec app php artisan route:cache
docker-compose exec app php artisan view:cache

# Optimize Composer autoloader
docker-compose exec app composer dump-autoload --optimize
```

## üìö Best Practices

### Code Quality

#### Pre-commit Checks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
npm install --save-dev eslint

# Run before committing
composer run phpstan
npm run lint
php artisan test
```

#### Branch Strategy

```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (staging)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/issue-123-new-feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/issue-456-critical-fix
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/security-patch
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Test Coverage

- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Critical paths require integration tests

#### Test Types

```php
// Unit Tests
tests/Unit/Services/RecipeServiceTest.php

// Feature Tests  
tests/Feature/Api/V1/RecipeControllerTest.php

// Browser Tests
tests/Browser/RecipeManagementTest.php
```

### Deployment Strategy

#### Environment Promotion

```
Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
```

#### Rollback Strategy

```bash
# Automated rollback triggers
- Health check failures
- Performance degradation
- Error rate spike

# Manual rollback process
./scripts/rollback-production.sh [previous-version]
```

### Security Practices

#### Dependency Management

- Automated security updates
- Regular dependency audits
- Vulnerability scanning in CI

#### Secret Management

```bash
# Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
# Never commit secrets to repository
# Rotate secrets regularly
# Use environment-specific secrets
```

### Monitoring Best Practices

#### Key Metrics

- Response time (< 2 seconds)
- Error rate (< 1%)
- Availability (> 99.9%)
- Database performance (< 100ms queries)

#### Alerting Rules

```yaml
Critical: 
  - Application down > 1 minute
  - Error rate > 5%
  - Response time > 5 seconds

Warning:
  - Response time > 2 seconds  
  - Error rate > 1%
  - Disk usage > 80%
```
